Using Excel, R, and Python, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), identified key trends, and generated insightful reports. My findings helped the retailer optimize inventory and marketing strategies, ultimately boosting shop revenue. This project was recognized as the best of the term for its impact and analytical depth.\n- **Modern Application Development I -** Developed a ticket booking system with a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The backend was built with Flask, while PostgreSQL was used for database management. The project demonstrated my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies effectively.\n- **Modern Application Development II -** Built an advanced UI of ticket booking system using Vue.js and React.js, focusing on responsiveness and performance. The backend was developed with Flask, integrating PostgreSQL for database management, Redis for caching, and Celery for task scheduling. This project showcased my skills in modern full-stack development.\n- **Machine Learning Practice -** Solved a classification problem using ensemble learning techniques, feature selection, and feature extraction. I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to refine the model. My solution earned a top 10 rank out of 600 students, demonstrating strong ML skills and problem-solving ability.\n- **Software Engineering -** Collaborated with a team to build an AI-integrated edtech platform aimed at enhancing student learning. We developed LLM-based flows to assist students in debugging code and running programming assignments more efficiently, making the learning process smoother and more interactive.\n- **Strategies for Professional Growth -** Worked in a team, conducting interviews and gathering insights from professionals. I wrote detailed reports based on findings and focused on learning essential workplace etiquette. This experience helped me develop communication and interpersonal skills vital for success in a professional environment.\n- **Market Research -** Collaborated with a team to collect employee satisfaction data from 200 respondents. I learned to design effective survey questions and performed data analysis using Python and R to create visualizations. Finally, I compiled the findings into a comprehensive report and presentation for stakeholders.\n- **Design Thinking -** Worked with a team to apply the Karmic design thinking methodology through all four stages. I developed a fully functional mobile application that provides trending news and research papers in AI and ML, focusing on user needs and ensuring a seamless experience across various fields.\n\n\n# Publications {.anchor #publications}\n\n- **Search Algorithms: Introductory Guide**, Tech Blog, November 2024.
